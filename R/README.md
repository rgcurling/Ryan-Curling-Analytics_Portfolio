### Probability Models for Continuous Quantites

Goal: To create probability models for continuous quantities in various business cases.

Description: This project explores probability models for continuous data, using R to analyze PDFs, CDFs, and descriptive statistics. It involves fitting real-world data (e.g., MLB stats, Spotify features) to distributions like normal, Weibull, and beta, evaluating their fit with statistical measures and visualizations.

Skills: R, probability modeling, data visualization, distribution fitting, descriptive statistics, integration, optimization, real-world data analysis, statistical interpretation, predictive modeling.

Technology: R, ggplot2, fitdistrplus.

Results: The results demonstrated that different distributions (e.g., Weibull, beta) are best suited for modeling specific data characteristics, as seen in MLB stats and Spotify features. We learned how to assess distribution fits using statistical metrics (AIC) and visual tools (QQ plots, histograms), highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate models for accurate data representation and interpretation. This analysis reinforced the utility of probabilistic modeling in real-world applications.
