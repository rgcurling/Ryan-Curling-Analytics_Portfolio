# Ryan Curling - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hello, I'm Ryan Curling, a data enthusiast with a strong foundation in business analytics and a passion for leveraging data to solve complex challenges. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics from The University of Tennessee, Haslam School of Business, graduating Summa Cum Laude, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business.

I thrive in roles where I can use data to uncover insights and drive decision-making. Whether it's through creating automated reporting systems, developing predictive models, or optimizing operational processes, I am committed to delivering impactful results.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Probability Models for Continuous Quantites
**Code:**

**Goal:** To create probability models for continuous quantities in various business cases.

**Description:** This project explores probability models for continuous data, using R to analyze PDFs, CDFs, and descriptive statistics. It involves fitting real-world data (e.g., MLB stats, Spotify features) to distributions like normal, Weibull, and beta, evaluating their fit with statistical measures and visualizations.

**Skills:** R, probability modeling, data visualization, distribution fitting, descriptive statistics, integration, optimization, real-world data analysis, statistical interpretation, predictive modeling.

**Technology:** R, ggplot2, fitdistrplus.

**Results:** The results demonstrated that different distributions (e.g., Weibull, beta) are best suited for modeling specific data characteristics, as seen in MLB stats and Spotify features. We learned how to assess distribution fits using statistical metrics (AIC) and visual tools (QQ plots, histograms), highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate models for accurate data representation and interpretation. This analysis reinforced the utility of probabilistic modeling in real-world applications.
