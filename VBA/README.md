## Automated Shift-Wash Email Macro

Goal: To automate the creation and sending of shift-wash emails for Amazon operations to save time, improve consistency, and standardize communication.

Description: This project automated the process of creating shift-wash emails, which were previously done manually by the operations team. Using VBA macros, the project dynamically generated email subjects and embedded operational data directly into the email body, significantly reducing the time needed for the task. 
The macros included features for both "Days" and "Nights" shifts and ensured minimal training for operations managers through a simple button-based interface.

Skills: VBA programming, email automation, process optimization, Excel integration, workflow efficiency improvement, user interface simplicity.

Technology: VBA, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook.

Results: The automation reduced the email creation time from 10â€“15 minutes to under 1 minute per shift, enhanced the consistency of email formats, and ensured ease of use for managers. The project demonstrated the value of automation in streamlining repetitive tasks, improving communication quality, and saving time in operational processes.
