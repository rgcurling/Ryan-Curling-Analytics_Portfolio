## Automated Shift-Wash Email Macro

Goal: To automate the creation and sending of shift-wash emails for Amazon operations to save time, improve consistency, and standardize communication.

Description: This project automated the process of creating shift-wash emails, which were previously done manually by the operations team. Using VBA macros, the project dynamically generated email subjects and embedded operational data directly into the email body, significantly reducing the time needed for the task. 
The macros included features for both "Days" and "Nights" shifts and ensured minimal training for operations managers through a simple button-based interface.

Skills: VBA programming, email automation, process optimization, Excel integration, workflow efficiency improvement, user interface simplicity.

Technology: VBA, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook.

Results: The automation reduced the email creation time from 10â€“15 minutes to under 1 minute per shift, enhanced the consistency of email formats, and ensured ease of use for managers. The project demonstrated the value of automation in streamlining repetitive tasks, improving communication quality, and saving time in operational processes.

## KPI Shift Comparison Web Scraping Project

Description:
This project addressed a significant gap in Amazon's operational data visibility by creating an automation system for shift-specific inbound Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Using Excel VBA macros, the system pulled data from various internal portals, consolidated it into structured Excel reports, and enabled shift-level performance monitoring. Initially implemented at a single fulfillment site, it was later scaled regionally to multiple centers.

Skills:
Excel VBA, web scraping, data automation, KPI analysis, operational reporting, dynamic URL construction, authentication integration, modular scripting, scalability, error handling.

Technology:
Microsoft Excel VBA, WinHTTP Library, APIs, Midway authentication.

Results:
The project improved data granularity by enabling shift-level KPI visibility, empowering managers to identify underperforming shifts and take timely corrective actions. It enhanced decision-making, reduced manual data processing, and ensured scalability across regional centers. Robust error handling and modular design allowed seamless integration of new sites and metrics. Key metrics like units processed and time worked were delivered efficiently, enabling better operational accountability and performance monitoring. Lessons learned included the importance of stakeholder collaboration, comprehensive documentation, and rigorous testing.
