# Data Analysis in Python

## International Football Analysis

Goal: To analyze international football data, uncover insights, trends, and performance metrics for teams, players, and tournaments.

Description: This project integrates multiple datasets (Goalscorers, Results, Shootouts) for in-depth analysis. Key tasks include assessing team and player performance, identifying top scorers and World Cup winners, evaluating rivalries, and examining host country trends. Confederation mappings provide regional insights, and statistical metrics like win rate and goal difference identify top-performing teams. Data preprocessing, such as merging datasets and cleaning missing values, is foundational to the analysis.

Skills:

- Data Preprocessing: Merging datasets, mapping confederations, and handling missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing match results, tournament outcomes, and top-performing teams.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluating team success via win rate, goal differential, and tournament wins.
- Visualization: Summarizing results with tables for top scorers, rivalries, and team performance.
  
Technology: Leveraging Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for data manipulation and visualization.
